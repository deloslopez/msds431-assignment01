# MSDS Assignment 1 Week 2

Project

The intent of this project is to recreate python and r code in go for the anscombe data frame. We are supposed to recreate the data frame and conduct a linear regression on the 4 quartets of data.

You would run main.go first and that should give you the linear regression results. Main_test.go is the test file for the main program. The python and r files are there as well.
