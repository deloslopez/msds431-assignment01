package main

//import any go packages needed?

// create anscombe data frame

// create linear regression models by ordinary least squares

// create scatterplots (? don't think it is necessary)

// use testing package to obtain execution times

// Other questions
// batch execution? how do I run all three on command line executions?
// it says to run each hundreds or averaging across runs
// do i need to change the python and r files to obtain execution times? or how do i make a log?
